# Medical Elbow Orthosis: Robotic Arm

I had the privilege to re-design a robotic arm for a five-year old with Acute Flaccid Myelitis, which is a disease that attacks motor cells in the spinal area, specifically nerves. This five-year old, named Max, goes to my church and was born with this disease.

This project was a continuation of a final project for UC San Diegoâ€™s MAE 156B class. It utilized a single Arduino Uno and two motors to lift Max's arms up and down. Flex cable sensors were connect to makeshift gloves that allow max to control the machine's movements through his wrist movement.

Unfortunately, this device was very inefficient, being that Max had to wear a vest containing a box with the Arduino, two 9v batteries, and wires coming out and dangling along his arms. In the long-run, this was not an effective design. An electrical engineer and I re-designed the arm by using two Arduino Unos, one for each arm. We constructed a design that was compact and lighter. 

I helped re-write the code and clean it. I also redesigned the flex cable sensors and made a more permanent solution. I also soldered thinner wires to lighten the load, and made multiple flex cable sensor attachments that would simply be plug-n-play if a sensor were to break.

Through these changes, Max now has a device that he can rely on daily. There is still a lot to be done, but I plan to go through more re-designs and to ultimately create something long-lasting for him in the future!
